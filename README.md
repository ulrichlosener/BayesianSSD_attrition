# BayesianSSD_attrition

This repository contains the R code necessary to perform Bayesian sample size determination for longitudinal trials with linear or log-linear growth using the `BayesSSD` package. This package can be dowloaded from `https://github.com/ulrichlosener/BayesSSD`. 

The code for the simulation study from the paper submitted to Psychological Methods can be found in the file "simulation_missing".

Different Attrition patterns are taken into account by means of survival functions. To get an impression of how these survival functions can model drop-out, see out the corresponding ShinyApp on https://losener.shinyapps.io/attrition-survival/.
