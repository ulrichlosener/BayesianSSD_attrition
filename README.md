# BayesianSSD_attrition

This repository contains the R code necessary to perform Bayesian sample size determination for longitudinal trials with linear or log-linear growth. Different Attrition patterns are taken into account by means of a survival function. To get an impression of how these survival functions can model drop-out, check out the corresponding ShinyApp on https://losener.shinyapps.io/attrition-survival/.
