This results in a loss of information that can have large negative effects on statistical power. Therefore, one should take expected drop-out rates into account when performing sample size determination (SSD) to avoid underpowered studies (Moerbeek, 2020). Suppose we want to measure N individuals n times for the purpose of testing hypotheses about a potential treatment effect over time and want to take expected attrition into account in our SSD. This can be done by modelling the expected attrition pattern via a survival function. To do this, we make a number of assumptions:"),

The graph of this function can be interpreted as the expected proportion of individuals who dropped so far for each measurement occasion j.
